# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-rays
This project aims at analyzing data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence or pneumonia. The projects aims to culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy.

## Why??
Chest X-ray exams are one of the most frequent and cost effective types of medical imaging examinations. Deriving clinical diagnoses from chest X-rays can be challenging , however, even by skilled radiologists.

When it comes to pneumonia, chest X-rays are the best available method for diagnosis.

The high prevalence of pneumonia makes it a good candidate for the development of a deep learning application for two reasons: 1) Data availability in a high enough quantity for training deep learning models for image classification 2) Opportunity for clinical aid by providing higher accuracy image reads of a difficult-to-diagnose disease and/or reduce clinical burnout by performing automated reads of very common scans.

The diagnosis of pneumonia from chest X-rays is difficult for several reasons:

1. The appearance of pneumonia in a chest X-ray can be very vague depending on the 2. stage of the infection
3. Pneumonia often overlaps with other diagnoses
4. Pneumonia can mimic benign abnormalities


## About the data set

you can download the data from https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data and run it locally.
