# Pneumonia-Detection-from-Chest-X-rays
This project aims at analyzing data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence or pneumonia. The projects aims to culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy.
